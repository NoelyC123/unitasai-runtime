# UnitasAI Runtime

This repository is the **runtime / execution / experimentation layer** for UnitasAI.

Canonical design specifications are frozen and stored separately:
https://github.com/NoelyC123/unitasai-canon-v0.1

Rules:
- Canon is treated as read-only input.
- All implementation, experimentation, tooling, UI, CLI, agents, and integrations live here.
- No Canon rules are modified here; changes require Canon v0.2+ in the Canon repo.

This repo is safe to analyse with:
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Grok
- Static analysis tools
- Experimental refactors
