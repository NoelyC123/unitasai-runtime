# Phase 24 — Canon Review & Direction Lock

## Scope of Review

This phase formally reviews and ratifies the completed development phases of UnitasAI from:

- Phase 21B++a — Audit Semantic Normalisation
- Phase 21B++b — Advisory Evaluation Layer
- Phase 21B++c — Temporal Authority Drift Windows
- Phase 21B++d — Drift Presentation & Summarisation
- Phase 21B++e — Cross-Signal Temporal Correlation
- Phase 21C — Stability & Recovery Metrics
- Phase 22 — Epistemic Health Index (EHI)
- Phase 23 — Governance & Audit Export

All listed phases are considered complete, correct, and frozen.

No phase within this scope may be reopened, modified, or reinterpreted.


## System Identity Statement

UnitasAI is an epistemic observatory system.

It observes, aggregates, and presents descriptive information about decision processes, authority patterns, and governance-relevant signals derived from runtime audit data.

UnitasAI is not a decision-making system.
UnitasAI is not a control system.
UnitasAI is not an optimisation system.


## Canonical Authority Statement

Authority within UnitasAI is never originated, exercised, or delegated.

All authority observed by the system originates externally, from human or institutional actors operating outside the system boundary.

UnitasAI may describe authority.
UnitasAI may correlate authority-related signals.
UnitasAI may summarise authority behaviour over time.

UnitasAI may not:
- create authority
- recommend authority
- prioritise authority
- enforce authority


## Observational Boundary (Permanent)

“Observatory-only” means:

- No mutation of RuntimeStore data
- No emission of new audit events
- No feedback into controller logic
- No alteration of admissibility or evaluation outcomes
- No thresholds that trigger actions
- No automated responses

This boundary is permanent and may not be crossed in future phases.


## Future Change Policy

### Allowed Changes
- Additional descriptive metrics
- New presentation or export formats
- Improved documentation and explanations
- External audit tooling that consumes existing outputs

### Conditionally Allowed Changes
- New observatory layers, provided they remain:
  - read-only
  - case-scoped
  - non-normative
  - non-binding

### Permanently Forbidden Changes
- Any form of autonomous decision-making
- Any system that ranks, scores, or selects actors
- Any feedback loop into runtime control paths
- Any optimisation or recommendation engine
- Any mechanism that alters human or institutional authority


## Formal Ratification

By this document, Phases 21 through 23 are formally ratified.

Their outputs are considered canonical, stable, and constitutionally bounded.

Phase 24 closes the observational expansion era of UnitasAI and locks the system’s directional constraints.

No future phase may violate the principles stated herein.
