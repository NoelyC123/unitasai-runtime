# Canon Explained — UnitasAI

This document explains Canon for readers who did not build UnitasAI.

It is written for:
- auditors
- regulators
- future engineers
- governance reviewers

It is intentionally independent of implementation details.


## What Canon Is

Canon is the constitutional boundary of UnitasAI.

It defines:
- what the system is
- what the system is not
- what the system is allowed to do
- what the system is permanently forbidden from doing

Canon exists to prevent authority from emerging accidentally.


## Why Canon Exists

Most complex systems accumulate authority over time.

This often happens unintentionally:
- advisory tools become decision tools
- metrics become thresholds
- observation becomes intervention

Canon exists to stop that drift.


## Authority in UnitasAI

Authority means the power to:
- decide
- enforce
- permit
- deny
- optimise outcomes

UnitasAI does not possess authority.

It never has.
It never will.


## What UnitasAI Does Instead

UnitasAI:
- observes
- records
- aggregates
- correlates
- summarises

All outputs are descriptive.
All outputs are retrospective.
All outputs are non-binding.


## Why UnitasAI Refuses to Act

Action creates responsibility.
Responsibility creates authority.

UnitasAI refuses to act so that:
- responsibility remains human
- accountability remains external
- governance remains explicit


## Canon and Change

Canon does not prevent change.

Canon prevents **certain kinds of change**.

Allowed changes:
- new observability
- new summaries
- new descriptive metrics
- new exports

Forbidden changes:
- control paths
- decision logic
- automated enforcement
- optimisation targets

If a change would allow UnitasAI to act, decide, or enforce,
Canon forbids it by definition.


## Long-Term Validity

This document is designed to remain valid even if:
- the codebase changes
- new observatories are added
- new metrics are introduced

As long as Canon is respected,
UnitasAI remains the same kind of system.
