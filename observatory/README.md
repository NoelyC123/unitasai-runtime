# Runtime Authority Drift Observatory (RADO)

## Status
Runtime-only observatory module.

## Canonical Position
This module is NOT part of Canon v0.1.
It introduces NO new behaviour, authority, mitigation, or governance.
It MUST NOT influence runtime decisions.

## Purpose
RADO exists solely to:
- Observe
- Measure
- Report

post-hoc patterns of authority drift using existing audit records.

## Explicit Non-Goals
RADO MUST NOT:
- Recommend actions
- Emit alerts
- Define thresholds
- Classify risk
- Influence controllers
- Block or modify execution
- Write back to storage
- Serve as a governance mechanism

## Authority Statement
All outputs produced by RADO are:
- Descriptive only
- Non-authoritative
- Non-normative
- Non-actionable

Interpretation, response, or mitigation—if any—must occur outside the system.

## Failure Mode Acknowledgment
RADO may accurately describe authority collapse without preventing it.
This is expected and compliant with Canon v0.1.
