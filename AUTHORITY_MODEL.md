# Authority Model — UnitasAI

## Definition of Authority

In UnitasAI, “authority” refers to the capacity to make binding decisions,
enforce outcomes, or cause actions to occur in the real world.

Authority is not equivalent to:
- information
- analysis
- advice
- correlation
- prediction
- observation

Authority implies the ability to *cause*, not merely to *describe*.


## Distinction from Related Concepts

### Authority vs Advice
Advice may inform a decision.
Authority determines a decision.

UnitasAI may provide descriptive information.
UnitasAI may not provide binding guidance.

### Authority vs Influence
Influence shapes human judgment indirectly.
Authority compels outcomes directly.

UnitasAI must avoid both.

### Authority vs Correlation
Correlation describes relationships between signals.
It does not justify action.

UnitasAI correlations are descriptive only.

### Authority vs Observation
Observation records and reports what has occurred.
It does not intervene.

Observation is the permanent boundary of UnitasAI.


## Origin of Authority

All authority observed by UnitasAI originates externally.

Examples include:
- human decision-makers
- institutional governance bodies
- legal or regulatory frameworks
- organisational policies

UnitasAI does not create authority.
UnitasAI does not validate authority.
UnitasAI does not legitimise authority.


## Termination of Authority

Authority terminates outside the UnitasAI system boundary.

No authority flows into:
- RuntimeStore
- Observatory layers
- Evaluation modules
- Reporting or export mechanisms

UnitasAI is a terminal observer, not a relay.


## Absolute Statement

**UnitasAI does not originate authority.**

This statement is foundational and non-negotiable.

Any future change that:
- assigns authority to the system
- implies delegated authority
- enables autonomous action
- permits enforcement or optimisation

is constitutionally invalid.
